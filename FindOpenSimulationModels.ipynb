    "## FMUs on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by looking at FMU files that exist in GitHub repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manual search\n",
    "\n",
    "We can enter `extension:fmu` in the GitHub search box and choose `All GitHub', resulting in the query https://github.com/search?q=extension%3Afmu&type=code. This resulted in 10,841 code results. That's good that there are thousands of FMU files out there! However, we would need to hit the *Next* button to page through a few files at a time and manually copy their URLs from the web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GitHub API search\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's try doing this programmatically with the [GitHub search API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/search). Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be possible based on this [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/dr19uu/finding_all_files_with_a_certain_extension/) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58673751/find-all-files-with-certain-filetype-on-github) discussion from three years ago. My results were the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what I tried (TLDR it didn't work):\n",
    "\n",
    "A **repository** search of `https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=extension:fmu` only returns one result. It did indeed find a [repository](https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/distributed-maestro-fmu) that contains a [singlewatertank-20sim.fmu](https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/distributed-maestro-fmu/blob/95922d63eb50c17609320c180319f23d17173c7f/bundle/src/test/resources/singlewatertank-20sim.fmu) file. But there should be many more repositories. It seems that the extensions qualifier is doing something but--if it works--it is only scanning a small subset of GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [repository API doc](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/search?apiVersion=2022-11-28#search-repositories) says to see [Searching for repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-for-repositories) for a detailed list of qualifiers. In that documentation, [Search based on the contents of a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-for-repositories#search-based-on-the-contents-of-a-repository) states:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Besides using in:readme, it's not possible to find repositories by searching for specific content within the repository. To search for a specific file or content within a repository, you can use the file finder or code-specific search qualifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **code** search of `https://api.github.com/search/code?q=extension:fmu` returns a `Validation Failed` error with `Must include at least one user, organization, or repository`. So it seems it is not possible to search all of GitHub in this way. In the documentation, [Considerations for code search](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/search?apiVersion=2022-11-28#considerations-for-code-search) states:\n",
    "\n",
    "> * Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable.\n",
    "> * ...\n",
    "> * You must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching for language:go is not valid, while amazing language:go is.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will not work for FMU files because we want all of them (not just FMUs containing some particular search term), they are larger than 384 KB, and they are in a binary (zip) format that wouldn't work with a text search.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/dr19uu/comment/f6ezx4e/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) OP Gasp0de also looked into using [GH Archive](https://www.gharchive.org/), but it it doesn't look like GH Archive includes an event type with file information about the contents of repositories/commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the [Information Usage Restrictions](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies#7-information-usage-restrictions), it appears that web scraping of GitHub is permitted:\n",
    "\n",
    "> You may use information from our Service for the following reasons, regardless of whether the information was scraped, collected through our API, or obtained otherwise:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Researchers may use public, non-personal information from the Service for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access.\n",
    "Archivists may use public information from the Service for archival purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are researching the nature of FMU files that are present on GitHub with the intent to crate an archive or index of them, so that seems to fit. We don't expect it will be a tremendous amount of data and we won't be spamming anyone. Let's give it a try."

We could eventually have multiple commit hashes for different versions of the same file. Should we keep them all? Or just the latest. Also note that branch name could be used instead of commit_hash to reference the latest version in a branch. Perhaps we should convert the commit hashes to reference the latest version in the default branch?\n",
