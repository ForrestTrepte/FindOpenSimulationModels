It did indeed find a [repository](https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/distributed-maestro-fmu) that contains a [singlewatertank-20sim.fmu](https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/distributed-maestro-fmu/blob/95922d63eb50c17609320c180319f23d17173c7f/bundle/src/test/resources/singlewatertank-20sim.fmu) file.
