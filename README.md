# FindOpenSimulationModels

An experiment to find simulation models such as FMU and Modelica files on the open internet. I am curious how prevalent they are and whether they have inputs and outputs that would be suitable for reinforcement learning environments.

See the [FindOpenSimulationModels.ipynb](FindOpenSimulationModels.ipynb) Jupyter notebook for results.
